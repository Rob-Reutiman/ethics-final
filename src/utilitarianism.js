          <h3>Utilitarianism is an ethical framework that differentiates between right and wrong based on outcomes. The decision that is right is the one that produces the greatest amount of good for the most amount of people.

An important aspect of utilitarianism is impartiality and agent-neutrality -- everyoneâ€™s happiness is valued equally. Utilitarianism argues that in order to promote the overall utility and happiness in society, one should take actions that are beneficial for the most people.
